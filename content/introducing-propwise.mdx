Hey there! I'm super excited to share one of my recent side projects: **Propwise**, a real estate risk analysis tool. It's a web application that helps investors make informed decisions by analyzing neighborhood data and market trends.

This project was born from my interest in data analysis and real estate. I wanted to build something that could turn complex market data into clear, actionable insights for property investors.

## 🧪 Why Propwise?

This is a **proof of concept** to explore how data analysis can help with real estate investment decisions. I wanted to see if combining market data with a clean, intuitive interface could help investors make better decisions. This project is part experiment, part learning opportunity — and 100% focused on practical value.

The goal is to simplify the complex process of property evaluation by providing clear risk assessments and market insights.

## 🛠️ The Tech Stack

This was a fullstack build, powered by:

- **HTML** + **CSS** + **JavaScript** for the frontend
- **Chrome Extension API** for browser integration
- **Real estate APIs** for market data
- **Data visualization** for clear insights

## 🧩 Challenges & Highlights

### 🕵️‍♂️ Working with Real Estate Data

Everything started with the data. Real estate data can be complex and inconsistent across different sources. I had to build robust data processing to ensure accurate risk assessments and market analysis.

### ⚙️ Building a Chrome Extension

One of the most interesting parts of this project was learning how to build a Chrome extension. I had to coordinate:

- The **extension interface** (HTML/CSS/JS)
- **API integrations** for real estate data
- **Data processing** and risk calculations
- **User experience** optimization

### ⚡ Making Data Accessible

I focused on making complex real estate data feel approachable and useful. The app provides **instant analysis**, **clear visualizations**, and **actionable insights**, so investors can quickly understand market conditions and risks.

## 🔮 Future Plans

This is just the start. Some features I'd love to add:

- ✨ **Machine learning** for better risk prediction
- 📊 **Advanced data visualization** and charts
- 🎯 **Personalized recommendations** based on user preferences
- 🧠 **Integration with more data sources** for comprehensive analysis

Thanks for reading, and let me know what you think! Whether you're into data analysis, real estate, or just like a good side project story — I hope Propwise gave you a spark of inspiration.
